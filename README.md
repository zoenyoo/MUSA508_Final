## Inspiration by the dataset owner:
Lots of interesting, high-impact projects could be driven by this data:

Robust prediction: This data could be used to derive a system-level prediction system for the NJ Transit network. Such a system could provide intelligent, targeted advance warnings of delays or cancellations for millions of riders.
Combining datasets: Weather data and service alert data could be incorporated to look at the effect of weather events and analyze the impacts of specific kinds of service interruptions.
Data visualization: Visualizing this data could provide robust insight into the system-level mechanics of the NJ Transit rail network, as well as more engaging reporting on NJ Transit.
